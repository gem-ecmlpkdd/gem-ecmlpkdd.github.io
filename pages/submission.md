All papers will be peer-reviewed, single-blinded. We welcome many kinds of papers, such as (and not limited to):
- Novel research papers
- Demo papers
- Work-in-progress papers
- Visionary papers (white papers)
- Appraisal papers of existing methods and tools (e.g., lessons learned)
- Relevant work that has been previously published

Authors should indicate in their abstracts the kind of submissions that the paper belongs to, to help reviewers better understand their contributions. Submissions must be in PDF, written in English, not longer than 16 pages (including references and supplemental material), and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style. Shorter papers (including extended abstracts) are also welcome.

Accepted papers will be presented as a poster in the poster session and a few will be selected to also give an oral presentation. The papers will be posted on the workshop website (unless the authors opt out), but will not be published in a formal proceeding.

For accepted papers, at least one author must register for the conference and attend the workshop to present the work.

Please submit via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gem2020).
