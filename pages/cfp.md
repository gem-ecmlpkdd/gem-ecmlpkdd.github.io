All types of approaches are welcome, e.g., graph neural networks, traditional ML, random walk methods, Bayesian inference, information theoretical approaches, and we encourage authors to consider the breadth of graph data types (attributed, dynamic graphs, etc.).


### The workshop 

The workshop will feature
- a keynote given by [Danai Koutra](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/),
- two poster sessions, and
- a few contributed talks.

Our workshop is geared towards interactive scientific exchange in small groups. To this end, we plan to have two poster sessions, (likely on gather.town or a similar service) that are separated by 2-3 selected paper presentations. After the second poster session, we plan to conclude the workshop with a best paper award and we will offer the registration fee for attendance to the main conference to one to the authors of this paper. By devoting most of the time of the workshop to an interactive poster session format, we want to foster the in-person interactions that are so direly needed in the current situation. To this end, the accepted papers will be presented as posters and short video pitches of 2-3 minutes that will be made available before the workshop. The videos can then be consumed asynchronously in advance by the workshop participants to identify interesting posters to attend. We plan to have a few highlight presentations between the two poster sessions for outstanding submissions and we will select a paper for a best paper award.


### Submission Information 

All papers will be peer-reviewed, single-blinded. We welcome many kinds of papers, such as (and not limited to):
- Novel research papers
- Demo papers
- Work-in-progress papers
- Visionary papers (white papers)
- Appraisal papers of existing methods and tools (e.g., lessons learned)
- Relevant work that has been previously published

We will solicit short (position) papers (3-5 pages) to present ongoing and preliminary works, long research papers (5-8 pages), and demos (3-5 pages). All accepted papers shall be presented in the poster sessions.

Authors should indicate in their abstracts the kind of submissions that the paper belongs to, to help reviewers better understand their contributions. Submissions must be in PDF, written in English, not longer than 8 pages (excluding references and supplemental material), and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style.
Accepted papers will be presented as a poster in the poster sessions and a few will be selected to also give an oral presentation. The papers will be posted on the workshop website (unless the authors opt out), but will not be published in a formal proceeding. Given enough interest by the workshop participants, we plan to extend a call for a special issue of a journal. To this end, we plan to invite high quality papers accepted at our workshop to submit extended versions.

For accepted papers, at least one author must register for the conference and attend the workshop to present the work.
