We invite contributions in the area of exploration and analytics on graphs (algorithms, models, tools, evaluations, etc.) to be presented at the GEM workshop which is to be held at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practices of Knowledge Discovery from Data (ECML-PKDD), that will take place online in Bilbao, Spain - 13 â€“ 17 September 2021.

#### Topics of interests include

**Representation learning**
- Network embedding
- Graph compression
- Knowledge graph embedding
- Graph neural networks
- Entity resolution/deduplication
- Clustering

**Trustworthy AI on Graphs**
- Algorithmic biases
- Algorithms and metrics for fairness
- Explainable graph learning
- Privacy preserving graph learning

**Pattern mining**
- Local patterns: community detection, subgraph mining
- Graph summarization
- Subgroup discovery on graphs

**Complex Network analysis**
- Attributed networks
- Evolving graphs
- Probabilistic and uncertain Networks
	
**Supervised learning**
- Classification
- Graph Kernels
- Link prediction
- Anomaly detection
- Knowledge graph completion

**Exploration**
- Visualization
- Visual analytics

**Modeling**
- Random graph models
- Opinion formation
- Information propagation

**Data management for graph analytics**
- Data models and structures
- Index structures

**Applications**
- Social network analysis
- Biological networks and life science data
- Communication networks
- User-item interaction networks in the recommendation scenario
- Urban data, traffic networks

All types of approaches are welcome, e.g., graph neural networks, traditional ML, random walk methods, Bayesian inference, information theoretical approaches, and we encourage authors to consider the breadth of graph data types (attributed, dynamic graphs, etc.).

#### The workshop

The workshop will feature
- keynote speakers,
- a few contributed talks,
- a poster session, and
- small-group discussions on hot topics that are aimed to bring together academia and industry or end-users in application areas.
It will be accompanied by a half-day tutorial dedicated to machine learning and analysis of large real-world graphs with scikit-network. 


Keynote speakers and the program committee will be announced soon!

#### Submission Information

All papers will be peer-reviewed, single-blinded. We welcome many kinds of papers, such as (and not limited to):
- Novel research papers
- Demo papers
- Work-in-progress papers
- Visionary papers (white papers)
- Appraisal papers of existing methods and tools (e.g., lessons learned)
- Relevant work that has been previously published

Authors should indicate in their abstracts the kind of submissions that the paper belongs to, to help reviewers better understand their contributions. Submissions must be in PDF, written in English, not longer than 16 pages (including references and supplemental material), and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style. Shorter papers (including extended abstracts) are also welcome.

Accepted papers will be presented as a poster in the poster session and a few will be selected to also give an oral presentation. The papers will be posted on the workshop website (unless the authors opt out), but will not be published in a formal proceeding.

For accepted papers, at least one author must register for the conference and attend the workshop to present the work.
